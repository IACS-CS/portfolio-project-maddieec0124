                <p>
                    Hi! I'm Maddie, a student at IACS graduating in 2025. I have been at IACS since 5th grade. </p>
                    <p> When i'm not in school, I spend time with my horse Lucifer aka Luke, pictured on the right,
                     and my other horse Fabu Fling JJ aka JJ, not pictured. I have been riding horses since I was
                     six years old, and plan on working in the equine industry after high school during a gap year,
                     and of course after college majoring in Marketing. I also enjoy spending time with my two cats 
                    Pax and Luna, and I like to bake and cook when time allows.  </p>

        <a href="https://iacs-zen-garden.netlify.app/#maddieec0124" target="_blank">CSS Zen Garden</a>
        <p2>The CSS Zen Garden project required us to use set HTML and make a webpage to our liking and theme using only CSS. 
            My webpage, astronomy inspired, includes CSS animations of a shooting star, showing the power, skill, and beauty of 
        pure CSS.  </p2>
        <a href="https://github.com/IACS-CS/project-imitation-mmmm.git" target="_blank">Imitation Project</a>
        <p2>In the Imitation project, we found a image or physical object and used HTML and CSS to recreate it online. 
            For my imitation, I used the Lindt Raspberry Framboise dark chocolate bar.

        <a href="https://github.com/IACS-CS/business-card-maddieec0124.git" target="_blank">Business Card Project</a>
        <p2>My Business Card Project shows a fake business card for a photography business, utilizing an AI image generator
            for images on the business cards, and flexbox to make the layout professional.
